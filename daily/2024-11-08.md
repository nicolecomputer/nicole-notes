## QOTD

## Creative Coding

Late night, making paint splatters and listening to [Nala Sinephro - Endlessness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyvqVDAGU0s):

This was to explore `randomGaussian`. I might play with this some more and use the mouse to let a creator throw more paint at the canvas by clicking on it.


## Arduino Day

"If something can be played or worked, always play it" - [@shenaichan](https://github.com/shenaichan)

### Setting up arduino

1. Install the arduino software: `yay arduino` (Arch delights me that the command for getting software from the community is `yay`)
2. Install the board software in arduino
3. Give access to the serial port to the arduino software `sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0`

### First Sketch

```c
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(200);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(200);                      // wait for a second
}
```

This blinks the light on the board!

## Euler Problem

Today's problem is "What is 10,001 prime number". And my solution looks like this:

```typescript
nthElement(primes(), 10_001)
```

Which I feel really happy about. The generator code for primes is the same that I've used in previous days:

```typescript

```

## End of day
