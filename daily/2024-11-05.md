## Euler Problem 002

Today's problem was to get the sum of all even numbered Fibonacci numbers below four million. There's a bunch of support code but here's my solution:

```typescript
const result = allFibonacciLessThan(4_000_000)
	.filter(isEven)
	.reduce(sum)

console.log(result)
```

This was a good chance to play with generators in JavaScript. [Generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) are a fancy [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) that can generate an infinite sequence which is perfect for Fibonacci numbers.

One thing that's disappointing, though, is that I hoped I could use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` right on a generator and that turns out not to be possible. If it had been possible I would love to have written a `takeUntil` function that took a generator and a condition and stopped when the condition was fulfilled. That could have looked like

```typescript
takeUntil(fibonacci, (n) => n > 4_000_000)
	.filter(isEven)
	.reduce(sum)
```

Which is maybe a little bit cleaner?

## Working from the NY Public Library

I'm writing this right now from the NY Public library research and study room. Pictures aren't allowed. Around me people are working quietly, mostly on laptops, although a few are writing in books or pouring over notes. All of the zoom is dark and old and after a course of wood the walls rise into blocks of stone before meeting an ornate ceiling with a mural of clouds in the middle.

The room smells of old books and study but unfortunately there don't seem to be many books remaining. Ahead of me are gold lettered words that say "Library Catalog" but for the most part the shelves beneath are empty.

There is a murmur of conversation but it's pouring in through the open door. No one here is talking now.

The room is lit with chandeliers descended from the ornate ceiling with rows and rows of bulbs. On the table are brass lamps. Although since most of us are writing on laptops they are mostly going unused.

## Publishing Notes

I want a way to share my notes as I take them. I had some ideas that I wanted to try out vimwiki or emacs for my duration at Recurse but it's also seems clear, even in the first day, that there is so much to do and learn and be involved with and I don't

### Auto Syncing obsidian with git

There's a [git plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) for Obsidian that lets it automatically commit and push changes to git.
