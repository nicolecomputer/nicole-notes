## Euler Problem 002

Today's problem was to get the sum of all even numbered Fibonacci numbers below four million. There's a bunch of support code but here's my solution:

```typescript
const result = allFibonacciLessThan(4_000_000)
	.filter(isEven)
	.reduce(sum)

console.log(result)
```

This was a good chance to play with generators in JavaScript. [Generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) are a fancy [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) that can generate an infinite sequence which is perfect for Fibonacci numbers.

One thing that's disappointing, though, is that I hoped I could use `map`/`filter`/`reduce` right on a generator and that turns out not to be possible. If it had been possible I would love to have written a `takeUntil` function that took a generator and a condition and stopped when the condition was fulfilled. That could have looked like

```typescript
takeUntil(fibonacci, (n) => n > 4_000_000)
	.filter(isEven)
	.reduce(sum)
```

Which is maybe a little bit cleaner?
