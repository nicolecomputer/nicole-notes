## Mouse Walker II

Goals:
- Create new function `moveTowards` and give coordinates (for this it'll be the mouse)
	- The closer to the target the more likely to move towards it
	- There should be a zone close to the target where moving towards isn't likely anymore (avoiding collisons, maybe)
- Create new function `moveRandomly`
	- Only move in available directions (at the wall don't consider moving in a way that's not allowed)
