## Morning Conversations

- This morning [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and I sat the lunch table and chatted
	- Uses [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with caps lock rebound to `<ctrl>` and uses that key as the leader key
	- Uses [lazy vim](http://www.lazyvim.org/) in the terminal with [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which is an IDE-like experience that looks really nice
	- Uses [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and other tools bound to alias's to replace their in-built tools
	- Uses [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) because it's faster than iTerm or other terminals and there's less latency with key input
- Chatted with [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and [@NBeing](https://github.com/NBeing) about NYC and recommendations for exploring
	- Prospect park is nicer than central park
	- Recommended vegan restaurants
		- Modern Love: Vegan Junk Food
		- Planta Queen: Asian fusion (the watermelon sushi is especially a highlight)
	- The Brooklyn library is worth spending time at
