## Morning Conversations

- This morning [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and I sat the lunch table and chatted
	- Uses [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with caps lock rebound to `<ctrl>` and uses that key as the leader key
	- Uses [lazy vim](http://www.lazyvim.org/) in the terminal with [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which is an IDE-like experience that looks really nice
	- Uses [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and other tools bound to alias's to replace their in-built tools
	- Uses [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) because it's faster than iTerm or other terminals and there's less latency with key input
- Chatted with [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and [@NBeing](https://github.com/NBeing) about NYC and recommendations for exploring
	- Prospect park is nicer than central park
	- Recommended vegan restaurants
		- Modern Love: Vegan Junk Food
		- Planta Queen: Asian fusion (the watermelon sushi is especially a highlight)
	- The Brooklyn library is worth spending time at

## Euler Problem

It's said "project oiler" (even if it's spelled differently). h/t [@ChiWilliams](https://github.com/ChiWilliams)

Today's problem was fun ([solution on Github](https://github.com/nicolecomputer/euler/tree/main/006)). Here's the solution: 

```typescript
function range(start: number, end: number): number[] {
    if (start > end) {
        return []
    }

    const length = end - start + 1;

    return [
        ...new Array(length).keys()
    ].map(i => i + start)
}


function sum(n: number, total: number | undefined): number {
    return (total || 0) + n
}

function square(n: number): number {
    return Math.pow(n, 2)
}

function squareOfSum(start: number, end: number): number {
    return square(range(start,end).reduce(sum))
}

function sumOfSquares(start: number, end: number): number {
    return range(start, end).map(square).reduce(sum)
}

function differenceOfSquares(start: number, end: number): number {
    return squareOfSum(start,end) - sumOfSquares(start,end)
}

function main() {
    console.log(differenceOfSquares(1,100)) //?
}

main();
```

I enjoyed this problem because it fell out so naturally. I wrote `range` and `sum` for previous problems. The solution feels so mathematical. One place I think it could be *different* (but maybe not better?) is to implement a `difference` function that takes as its arguments two functions and a set of parameters to apply to both of the functions and then returns the difference. I'm not sure this is better, though. That would look like:

```typescript
type Range = {
    start: number,
    end: number
}

function squareOfSum(r: Range): number {
    return square(range(r.start, r.end).reduce(sum))
}

function sumOfSquares(r: Range): number {
    return range(r.start, r.end).map(square).reduce(sum)
}


function difference<T>(fn1: (args: T) => number, fn2: (args: T) => number, args: T): number {
    return fn1(args) - fn2(args)
}

function main() {
    const result = difference(
        squareOfSum, sumOfSquares,
        { start: 1, end: 10 }) //?
    console.log(result)
}
```

This could further be improved by making difference generic over **any** number of arguments but I'm not sure that's needed for this.  I do like that the solution of the problem reads like this:

```typescript
difference(
        squareOfSum, sumOfSquares,
        { start: 1, end: 100 })
```

That feels *correct*. One problem is that programmers mostly don't read programs in the way that we wish they would. It would be helpful to say "this is where you should start" and then have details emerge as they are needed (Swift has this idea too and they call it ["progressive disclosure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure); also article chatting about [progressive disclosure](https://bitsplitting.org/2017/01/18/progressive-disclosure-in-swift/) )

## Movement Keys in VSCode

I am missing Mac OS's built in emacs keys SO much. (it has a default keybinding dictionary that binds `<ctrl>+a` to start of line, `<ctrl>+e` to end of line, `ctrl>+k` to put the current line in a yank buffer). 

[@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) suggested that I take a look at [vim keybindings](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) for VSCode. So I'm doing that today
