## Morning Conversations

- This morning [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and I sat the lunch table and chatted
	- Uses [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with caps lock rebound to `<ctrl>` and uses that key as the leader key
	- Uses [lazy vim](http://www.lazyvim.org/) in the terminal with [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which is an IDE-like experience that looks really nice
	- Uses [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and other tools bound to alias's to replace their in-built tools
	- Uses [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) because it's faster than iTerm or other terminals and there's less latency with key input
- Chatted with [@ywenk](https://github.com/tywenk) and [@NBeing](https://github.com/NBeing) about NYC and recommendations for exploring
	- Prospect park is nicer than central park
	- Recommended vegan restaurants
		- Modern Love: Vegan Junk Food
		- Planta Queen: Asian fusion (the watermelon sushi is especially a highlight)
	- The Brooklyn library is worth spending time at

## Euler Problem

It's said "project oiler" (even if it's spelled differently). h/t [@ChiWilliams](https://github.com/ChiWilliams)

Today's problem was fun ([solution on Github](https://github.com/nicolecomputer/euler/tree/main/006)). Here's the solution: 

```typescript
function range(start: number, end: number): number[] {
    if (start > end) {
        return []
    }

    const length = end - start + 1;

    return [
        ...new Array(length).keys()
    ].map(i => i + start)
}


function sum(n: number, total: number | undefined): number {
    return (total || 0) + n
}

function square(n: number): number {
    return Math.pow(n, 2)
}

function squareOfSum(start: number, end: number): number {
    return square(range(start,end).reduce(sum))
}

function sumOfSquares(start: number, end: number): number {
    return range(start, end).map(square).reduce(sum)
}

function differenceOfSquares(start: number, end: number): number {
    return squareOfSum(start,end) - sumOfSquares(start,end)
}

function main() {
    console.log(differenceOfSquares(1,100)) //?
}

main();
```

I enjoyed this problem because it fell out so naturally. I wrote `range` and `sum` for previous problems. The solution feels so mathematical. One place I think it could be *different* (but maybe not better?) is to implement a `difference` function that takes as its arguments two functions and a set of parameters to apply to both of the functions and then returns the difference. I'm not sure this is better, though.
