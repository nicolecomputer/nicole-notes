## Eueler Problem 3

Today's problem is about prime factorization and is another chance to learn about and use generators! This time I need a generator to generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers:

```typescript
function isPrime(n: number, knownPrimes: number[]): boolean {
    if (n == 2) {
        return true
    }

    for (const prime of knownPrimes) {
        if (n % prime == 0) {
            return false
        }
    }

    return true
}

function* primes() {
    yield 2

    let knownPrimes: number[] = [2]
    let currentNumber = 3

    while (true) {
        if (isPrime(currentNumber, knownPrimes)) {
            knownPrimes.push(currentNumber)
            yield currentNumber
        }

        currentNumber += 1
    }
}
```

Generators are neat! One thing I wonder about, though is caching. I'm going to need to use the prime generator several times and I wonder if there's a cached generator that I could use so that I don't have to re-find primes everytime I need them.
