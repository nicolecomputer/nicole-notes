## Eueler Problem 3

Today's problem is about prime factorization and is another chance to learn about and use generators! This time I need a generator to generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers:

```typescript
function isPrime(n: number, knownPrimes: number[]): boolean {
    if (n == 2) {
        return true
    }

    for (const prime of knownPrimes) {
        if (n % prime == 0) {
            return false
        }
    }

    return true
}

function* primes() {
    yield 2

    let knownPrimes: number[] = [2]
    let currentNumber = 3

    while (true) {
        if (isPrime(currentNumber, knownPrimes)) {
            knownPrimes.push(currentNumber)
            yield currentNumber
        }

        currentNumber += 1
    }
}
```

Generators are neat! One thing I wonder about, though is caching. I'm going to need to use the prime generator several times and I wonder if there's a cached generator that I could use so that I don't have to re-find primes everytime I need them. It feels like I could implement a generic memoization on top of generators that looks up the answer in an array orrrrrr it runs the internal generator

Here's my complete solution to [problem 3](https://github.com/nicolecomputer/euler)

## Creative Coding time

Today's prompt is: `home`

I learned A LOT about p5 in doing this.

I'm liking the structure of doing something like:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 400);

}

function draw() {
  background("#EDEBE9");


  update();
}

function update() {
}
```

I'm missing the type safety of typescript, though. I'm trading off type safety for the ability to have a like p5 window right next to the code which shows updates in real time. I wouldn't have been able to work on this otherwise.
