## Eueler Problem 3

Today's problem is about prime factorization and is another chance to learn about and use generators! This time I need a generator to generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers:

```typescript
function isPrime(n: number, knownPrimes: number[]): boolean {
    if (n == 2) {
        return true
    }

    for (const prime of knownPrimes) {
        if (n % prime == 0) {
            return false
        }
    }

    return true
}

function* primes() {
    yield 2

    let knownPrimes: number[] = [2]
    let currentNumber = 3

    while (true) {
        if (isPrime(currentNumber, knownPrimes)) {
            knownPrimes.push(currentNumber)
            yield currentNumber
        }

        currentNumber += 1
    }
}
```

Generators are neat! One thing I wonder about, though is caching. I'm going to need to use the prime generator several times and I wonder if there's a cached generator that I could use so that I don't have to re-find primes everytime I need them. It feels like I could implement a generic memoization on top of generators that looks up the answer in an array orrrrrr it runs the internal generator to get the next available value. Hmmmmm.

Here's my complete solution to [problem 3](https://github.com/nicolecomputer/euler)

## Creative Coding time

Today's prompt is: `home`

I learned A LOT about p5 in doing this.

I'm liking the structure of doing something like:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 400);

}

function draw() {
  background("#EDEBE9");


  update();
}

function update() {
}
```

I'm **missing the type safety of typescript**, though. I'm trading off type safety for the ability to have a like p5 window right next to the code which shows updates in real time. I wouldn't have been able to work on this otherwise.

I did a lot of thinking and doodling on this sketch on paper before I started working on bringing it to life. I'm trying to show the contrast between the outside world and noise and safety and expansiveness of home. I was thinking about shapes that feel "familiar" and shapes that feel "dangerous". For some reason triangles feel dangerous and fraught.

Here's a bunch of questions I was sitting with:
- What does home look like?
- Who is wanted in home?
- How am I different at home and in the world?
- What does it mean to regulate up or down and which happens at home?
- If home was a season what season would it be?
- What thoughts and feelings are allowed at home that don't fit in other spaces?
- What is safe about home? If safety was a shape, which one? If danger was a shape, which one?
- What does it mean to "come home"? Is it a place or a feeling or a person or something else?
- What colors feel like home? Which ones don't feel like home?
