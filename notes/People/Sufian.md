- Working on node connected programming language (kind of like music nodes but for code as a way to make jumping in to logic easier for design, dev, and PM)
- Lives in NYC with wife, grew up in Southern California, lived in SF for a while
- Likes NYC because there are kids and old people and people working and because it's not all career focused
- Grew up using QBasic and really likes QBasic as a great tool for exploring code
- Made a music app to explore different scales during creative coding time
