-  [ ] Javascript generators- further exploration
-  [x] Automatic templating for obsidian (I'd like every note to have front matter to make it easy to publish and tag)

## Web stuff
- Index for creative coding that gets generated when pushed to github
- Make notes private and publish somewhere else (maybe just pay Github their money for private Github for a year???? or maybe neocities)
