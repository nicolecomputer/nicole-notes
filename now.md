## Undo Project

**App URL**: [https://undo.nicole.computer/](https://undo.nicole.computer/)
**Code URL:** [https://github.com/nicolecomputer/undo](https://github.com/nicolecomputer/undo)
**Notes Tag:** #project-undo 
**Summary:** Exploring undo in a paint program. Rather than thinking of undo as a linear series of steps (draw a line, a circle, undo, a squiggle) I want to think of it as as a tree (line, circle, undo, squiggle and I can get back to the state with the circle). I'm borrowing ideas of how git thinks about branching.
